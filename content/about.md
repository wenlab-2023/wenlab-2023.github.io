# About WEN Lab

## Introduction

The Wearable Engineering and Neural Interface Laboratory (WEN Lab) at the University of Central Florida has been a center of excellence for rehabilitation, wearable engineering, robotics, and neural machine interfaces since its founding in 2023.

Our mission is to advance the field of wearable robotics and neural interfaces through innovative research, cutting-edge technology development, and collaborative partnerships that improve human lives and rehabilitation outcomes.

We focus on developing intelligent systems that seamlessly integrate with human users, providing intuitive control and enhanced mobility for individuals with physical impairments. Our interdisciplinary approach combines expertise in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and neuroscience to create next-generation assistive technologies.

## Research Areas

Our research encompasses four key areas, each addressing critical challenges in wearable robotics and neural interfaces:

### Gait Rehabilitation
Development of innovative technologies and methodologies for improving walking patterns and mobility in individuals with gait impairments. Our work includes advanced gait analysis systems, personalized rehabilitation protocols, and adaptive training algorithms that optimize recovery outcomes.

### Wearable Robotics
Design and control of exoskeletons and assistive devices for rehabilitation and mobility enhancement. We focus on creating lightweight, comfortable, and effective wearable robotic systems that can assist individuals with mobility impairments in daily activities and rehabilitation exercises.

### Human-in-the-loop Optimization of Wearable Robotics
Intelligent control systems that adapt to individual users through real-time optimization and personalized assistance. Our research develops algorithms that learn user preferences, adapt to changing conditions, and provide optimal assistance based on real-time feedback and performance metrics.

### Neural-Machine Interface
Brain-computer interfaces and neural machine interfaces for intuitive human-robot interaction using advanced signal processing and machine learning. We develop systems that decode neural signals from surface EMG, EEG, and other physiological sensors to enable natural and responsive control of robotic devices.
