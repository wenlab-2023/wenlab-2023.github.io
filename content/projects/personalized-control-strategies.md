## Project Overview

A multi-modal personalized control framework that integrates user preferences, physiological signals, and environmental context. Our approach demonstrates improved user satisfaction and performance compared to traditional control methods.

## Research Objectives

1. **Multi-modal Sensor Fusion**: Integrate multiple sensor modalities for comprehensive user state assessment
2. **User Preference Learning**: Develop algorithms to learn and adapt to individual user preferences
3. **Environmental Adaptation**: Create systems that respond to changing environmental conditions
4. **Real-time Optimization**: Implement real-time optimization algorithms for continuous improvement

## Key Features

- Multi-modal sensor fusion
- User preference learning
- Environmental adaptation
- Real-time optimization

## Technical Approach

### Multi-modal Integration

Our system combines:
- **Physiological signals**: EMG, EEG, heart rate variability
- **Environmental sensors**: Force sensors, IMUs, pressure sensors
- **User feedback**: Explicit ratings and implicit behavioral patterns

### Machine Learning Framework

We employ:
- **Reinforcement learning** for preference optimization
- **Deep learning** for pattern recognition
- **Transfer learning** for rapid adaptation to new users

## Applications

- Ankle exoskeleton control
- Upper limb prosthetics
- Rehabilitation robotics
- Assistive devices

## Expected Outcomes

- 30% improvement in user satisfaction
- 25% reduction in adaptation time
- Enhanced safety and reliability
- Broader accessibility for diverse user populations
