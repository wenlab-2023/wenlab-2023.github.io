## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing adaptive control algorithms for rehabilitation robotics applications. Our research aims to create intelligent control systems that can automatically adjust to individual patient needs and recovery progress.

## Research Objectives

1. **Patient-Specific Adaptation**: Develop algorithms that learn and adapt to individual patient characteristics
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Implement real-time assessment of rehabilitation progress
3. **Dynamic Control Adjustment**: Create systems that automatically adjust assistance levels
4. **Clinical Validation**: Validate effectiveness through clinical trials

## Key Features

- Real-time patient assessment
- Adaptive assistance levels
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Clinical trial integration

## Technical Approach

### Adaptive Control Framework

Our system employs:
- **Machine learning algorithms** for patient modeling
- **Real-time sensor fusion** for comprehensive assessment
- **Dynamic control laws** that adjust based on patient performance
- **Safety constraints** to ensure patient well-being

### Patient Assessment

We integrate multiple assessment modalities:
- **Biomechanical analysis** using motion capture
- **Physiological monitoring** with EMG and force sensors
- **Performance metrics** including range of motion and strength
- **Patient feedback** through questionnaires and ratings

## Applications

- Stroke rehabilitation
- Spinal cord injury recovery
- Post-surgical rehabilitation
- Neurological disorder treatment

## Expected Outcomes

- 40% improvement in rehabilitation outcomes
- 50% reduction in adaptation time
- Enhanced patient engagement and compliance
- Standardized assessment protocols
