## Project Overview

This project investigates human-in-the-loop optimization strategies for wearable robotics systems. We develop algorithms that continuously learn from user feedback and physiological signals to optimize device performance and user experience.

## Research Objectives

1. **Real-time Optimization**: Develop algorithms that optimize device parameters in real-time
2. **User Preference Learning**: Create systems that learn and adapt to user preferences
3. **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balance performance, comfort, and energy efficiency
4. **Long-term Adaptation**: Enable systems that improve over extended use periods

## Key Features

- Real-time parameter optimization
- User preference learning
- Multi-objective optimization
- Long-term adaptation capabilities

## Technical Approach

### Optimization Framework

Our approach combines:
- **Bayesian optimization** for efficient parameter search
- **Reinforcement learning** for preference learning
- **Multi-objective optimization** algorithms
- **Online learning** for continuous improvement

### Human-in-the-Loop Integration

We integrate multiple feedback sources:
- **Explicit feedback** through user ratings and preferences
- **Implicit feedback** from physiological signals
- **Performance metrics** including task completion and efficiency
- **Comfort assessments** through sensor data and user reports

## Applications

- Lower limb exoskeletons
- Upper limb prosthetics
- Assistive devices for daily living
- Rehabilitation robotics

## Expected Outcomes

- 35% improvement in user satisfaction
- 30% reduction in energy consumption
- Enhanced device personalization
- Improved long-term user adoption
