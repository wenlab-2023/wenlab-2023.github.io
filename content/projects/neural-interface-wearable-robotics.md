## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing real-time neural-machine interfaces using deep learning approaches for wearable robotics applications. We are working on novel algorithms that demonstrate improved signal processing and control performance compared to traditional methods.

## Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. **Real-time Neural Drive Decoding**: Develop algorithms to decode neural drive from high-density surface EMG signals in real-time
2. **Deep Learning Integration**: Implement advanced deep learning architectures for improved signal processing
3. **Wearable Robotics Control**: Create intuitive control interfaces for wearable robotic devices
4. **Performance Validation**: Validate the effectiveness of our approaches through clinical studies

## Key Achievements

- **Published in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering**
- **Improved signal processing accuracy by 25%**
- **Real-time neural drive decoding from high-density surface EMG**
- **Successfully integrated with ankle exoskeleton control**

## Technical Approach

### Signal Processing Pipeline

Our approach involves a multi-stage signal processing pipeline:

1. **High-density EMG Acquisition**: Using 64-channel surface EMG arrays
2. **Preprocessing**: Noise reduction and signal conditioning
3. **Feature Extraction**: Time-domain and frequency-domain features
4. **Neural Drive Decoding**: Deep learning-based decoding algorithms
5. **Control Signal Generation**: Real-time control commands for wearable robots

### Deep Learning Architecture

We employ a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture that combines:
- **Convolutional layers** for spatial feature extraction
- **LSTM layers** for temporal pattern recognition
- **Attention mechanisms** for focus on relevant signal components

## Experimental Results

### Performance Metrics

- **Decoding Accuracy**: 85.3% (improved from 60.2% baseline)
- **Processing Latency**: <50ms (real-time requirement met)
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.2/5.0 rating in usability studies

### Clinical Validation

Our system has been tested with:
- **10 healthy participants** in laboratory settings
- **5 individuals with mobility impairments** in clinical trials
- **3-month longitudinal study** showing sustained performance
