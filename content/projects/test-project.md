## Dynamic Project Loading Test

This is a test project to demonstrate that the dynamic content loading system works for projects as well!

### Project Overview

This test project showcases the flexibility of the dynamic content loading system. You can add, remove, or rename project files without ever touching the JavaScript code.

### Research Objectives

1. **Demonstrate Dynamic Loading**: Show that projects load automatically
2. **Test File Discovery**: Verify that new files are discovered automatically
3. **Validate Flexibility**: Confirm that file naming is completely flexible

### Methodology

The system works by:
1. Scanning the `content/projects/` directory
2. Creating a JSON listing of all `.md` files
3. Loading this listing dynamically in JavaScript
4. Rendering all discovered projects automatically

### Results

- âœ… **Dynamic Discovery**: All project files are found automatically
- âœ… **Flexible Naming**: Files can be named anything you want
- âœ… **No Code Changes**: Adding files requires no JavaScript updates
- âœ… **Automatic Updates**: Just run `./update_content.sh` (or `update_content.bat` on Windows)

### Future Work

This test project demonstrates that the entire content management system is now fully dynamic and flexible. You can:

- Add new projects with any filename
- Rename existing projects without breaking links
- Remove projects without manual cleanup
- Organize projects however you prefer

The dynamic loading system is working perfectly for all content types! ðŸš€
