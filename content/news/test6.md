## Dynamic Content Loading Works!

This is a test article to demonstrate that the new dynamic content loading system is working properly. 

### What This Means

- ✅ You can add new files without updating code
- ✅ You can rename files without breaking anything  
- ✅ You can remove files without manual cleanup
- ✅ The system automatically discovers all markdown files

### How to Use

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate directory
2. Add proper YAML front matter
3. Run `./update_content.sh`
4. Refresh your browser

That's it! No more hardcoded file lists in the JavaScript code.
