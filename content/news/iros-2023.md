Our team presented cutting-edge research on personalized control strategies for wearable robotics at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2023.

The WEN Lab was well-represented at IROS 2023, one of the premier conferences in robotics research. Our presentation on "Personalized Control Strategies for Wearable Robotics: A Multi-Modal Approach" received significant attention from the robotics community.

The research presented demonstrates our innovative approach to integrating user preferences, physiological signals, and environmental context in wearable robotics control systems.

This work represents a significant step forward in making wearable robotics more user-friendly and effective for rehabilitation applications.
