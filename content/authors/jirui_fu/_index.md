# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# bio: I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, human biomechanics, and intelligent systems. My work focuses on developing learning-based control policies for humanoid and assistive robotics, leveraging physics-based simulation environments as a foundation for sim-to-real transfer. I aim to create adaptable and efficient training methods that bridge the gap between virtual learning and real-world deployment.
