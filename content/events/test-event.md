## Dynamic Event Loading Test

This is a test event to demonstrate that the dynamic content loading system works for events as well!

### What This Proves

- âœ… Events are loaded dynamically from the file listing
- âœ… No hardcoded filenames in JavaScript
- âœ… You can add/remove/rename event files freely
- âœ… The system automatically discovers all event files

### Event Details

**Workshop Information:**
- **Date**: July 29, 2024
- **Location**: Orlando, FL
- **Type**: Workshop
- **Duration**: 2 hours

### Registration

This is a test event, so no actual registration is required. But in a real event, you would include registration information here.

### Agenda

1. **Introduction** (15 minutes)
2. **Main Workshop** (90 minutes)
3. **Q&A Session** (15 minutes)

The dynamic loading system is working perfectly for all content types! ðŸŽ‰
